            <p id="para-1">Our software takes into account the vehicle(year, make, model) and what problems and common issues that that vehicle has. It also considers maintenance and the depreciation of the vehicle over the length of its ownership. Our software considers the driver and their previous driving record. Based on this information, it will put together the most optimal package for that driver and car combination. </p>

            <p id="para-2">From powertrain warranties to GAP insurance, Credit Unions have lots of different options when creating a package to go along with the loan they are offering to the buyer. But Credit Unions are usually non chains and do not have access to tons of resources. How do they determine what is best to include in the package for the buyer. Usually this work is done by hand. They value of the vehicle is estimated and the Credit Union worker will throw in what warranty and insurance options that seem to be the best fit. </p>

            <p id="para-3">Many times,  Credit Unions just lack the resource or the ability to set up the programs and our software will allow these organization to break into that market much easier. They will not have to worry about all the paperwork and calculation as our software will take care of it all. And with the help of the 3rd party warranty/insurance companies, adding warranties and insurance to your already existing loans will be easier than ever. </p>
