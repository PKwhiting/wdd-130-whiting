            <p id="para-1">Many Federal Credit Unions have different types of insurances and warranties for individuals when not buying from a dealership. Consumers want the safety of a factory warranty but donâ€™t want to pay the hefty price tag for a new car. Consumers want the best package for them for the lowest cost. The responsibility of determining the best package of insurance and warranties lies on the Credit Union that is offering the package with the loan. From powertrain warranties to GAP insurance, Credit Unions have lots of different options when creating a package to go along with the loan they are offering to the buyer. But Credit Unions are usually non chains and do not have access to tons of resources. How do they determine what is best to include in the package for the buyer. Usually this work is done by hand. They value of the vehicle is estimated and the Credit Union worker will throw in what warranty and insurance options that seem to be the best fit. But when in comes down to it, every single car model is so unique and so are drivers. Some vehicles are much more susceptible to wear and tear compared to other makes and models. Their engines and transmission wear down much quicker and have a lot less usable life than other models. Additionally, some driver are more prone to get in accidents, overuse or abuse their car, and to be careless. Choosing a bad addition to a package could be detrimental to the Credit Union. A small mistake could cost the Credit Unions thousands of dollars in losses. And when you are selling hundreds of these packages, you are putting your Credit Union at much higher risk. Credit Unions need to find a way more effective way to choose the different options in the package that best protect the Credit Union, the individual receiving the loan, and the vehicle being purchased. The interactions between Credit Unions can be greatly improved just by improving this process. A simple software solution could fix this problem and that is where we come in. Our software is a simple plugin that works within Credit Unions already existing software. Our software does all the heavy lifting for the Credit Unions</p>
